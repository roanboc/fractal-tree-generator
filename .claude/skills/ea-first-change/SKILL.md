description: Use when requirements change or a new feature/behavior change is requested in this repo. Aligns the change through the enterprise architecture layers (strategy → business → information → application → technology), records it in a scope document, and only then implements. Not needed for pure bug fixes that change no documented behavior.

# EA-first change process

In this repository, **strategy and business architecture are validated
before any other layer is touched**. A requirement change is never
implemented directly: it is first aligned through the EA documents
(`docs/ea/`), then captured in a scope document (`docs/scope/`), and only
then coded. The folder numbers give you the assessment order.

## Step 1 — Walk the EA layers top-down

For each layer, read the layer README and answer its question for the
requested change. Update the affected documents as you go (they are part of
the same change set, not an afterthought):

1. **`docs/ea/1_strategy/`** — Does the change serve an existing goal and
   value-stream stage, or does it introduce a new stakeholder, driver, or
   goal? If it contradicts a Principle in `1_motivation.md` (e.g. "no
   backend", "bilingual by construction", "safety before spectacle"), stop
   and surface the conflict to the user instead of proceeding.
2. **`docs/ea/2_business/`** — Which business services/processes/objects
   are added or changed? New business rules get a row in the rules table of
   `5_domain-context-and-rules.md` (with the _why_) before they get code.
   New terms go into the glossary; reuse existing glossary terms in code.
3. **`docs/ea/3_information/`** — New or changed data objects, flows,
   representations, storage, classification, retention?
4. **`docs/ea/4_application/`** — Which application services/components
   change? New ports follow `5_interface-contracts.md` ("Adding a new
   port"); new platforms follow `4_solution-design.md` ("Adding a new
   platform").
5. **`docs/ea/5_technology/`** — Any impact on runtimes, build, CI, or
   hosting? (Remember: everything must build to static files; no backend.)

Layers with no impact still get a "no change" verdict — say so explicitly
in the scope document rather than skipping them.

## Step 2 — Write the scope document

Create the next-numbered file in `docs/scope/` using the `scope-doc` skill.
Do this **before implementing**; refine it as implementation proceeds.

## Step 3 — Implement

Only now write code. Keep the EA documents and the scope document true to
what is actually delivered — if implementation diverges from the plan,
update them in the same commit series. Follow `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the
development workflow (lint, typecheck, tests, build).

## Step 4 — Verify alignment before finishing

- Every new/changed code artifact is named by some EA document
  (components in `4_application/2_application-components.md`, data objects
  in `3_information/1_data-objects.md`, etc.).
- Every EA element you added names the code artifact that realizes it —
  the EA set stays verifiable against the code.
- The scope document's "in scope / out of scope" table matches the diff.
- Cross-links between docs resolve (paths, not just names, changed? update
  the links).

## Step 5 — PR description

When opening (or updating) the pull request, use the `pr-description`
skill: the body follows `.github/pull_request_template.md` and covers the
whole branch (`main...HEAD`), not just the latest commit.
