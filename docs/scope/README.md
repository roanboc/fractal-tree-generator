# Project Scope Documents

_[← Repository README](../../README.md) · [Enterprise architecture](../ea/README.md)_

One document per delivered (or in-flight) initiative, numbered
chronologically. While the [EA docs](../ea/README.md) describe the
**current** state of the system, each scope document describes one
**change**: what plateau it started from, what it delivered, and what it
deliberately left out.

**ArchiMate viewpoint:** Implementation & Migration (Work Package,
Deliverable, Plateau, Gap).

## The EA-first change process

Every change in requirements follows the same order — the same order the EA
folders are numbered in:

1. **Align the EA first.** Walk the layers top-down and record what the
   change means for each: [1_strategy](../ea/1_strategy/README.md) (does it
   serve an existing goal, or introduce a new driver?) →
   [2_business](../ea/2_business/README.md) (new/changed services,
   processes, rules?) → [3_information](../ea/3_information/README.md)
   (new/changed data objects, flows, storage?) →
   [4_application](../ea/4_application/README.md) (which services,
   components, ports change?) → [5_technology](../ea/5_technology/README.md)
   (any runtime, build, or hosting impact?). Update the affected EA
   documents in the same change.
2. **Document the scope.** Add the next-numbered file to this folder
   describing plateaus, work packages, in/out of scope, and gaps — before
   implementation starts, refined as it proceeds.
3. **Implement.** Only then write the code, keeping the scope document and
   EA docs in sync with what is actually delivered.

Agent guidance for this process lives in `.claude/skills/ea-first-change/`
and `.claude/skills/scope-doc/`; PR descriptions follow
`.github/pull_request_template.md` (see `.claude/skills/pr-description/`)
and must cover the whole branch.

| 4   | [4_project-structure-and-ea-docs.md](./4_project-structure-and-ea-docs.md)       | this branch  | Root cleanup, numbered EA docs as single source, skills, this process  |
| 5   | [5_navigation-and-rule-builder.md](./5_navigation-and-rule-builder.md)           | this branch  | One navigation system, rule-builder ordering/reordering, PR template   |

Scope documents 1–2 are **retrospective records**, reconstructed from the
git history after this process was adopted; from #3 onward, documents are
written as part of the initiative itself.
